Powder the whole spices/ garam masala (Cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom & Cumin Seeds) together excluding the black cardamom and bay leaf & set aside.
- In another small bowl, add the Kashmiri Chilli powder, fennel seed powder and ginger powder with 1/4 cup of water and mix together.
- In a heavy bottom pot, heat the ghee & oil on medium high then add the black cardamom & bay leaf to the oil.
- Then add the sliced shallots and fry them on medium-low heat until they start caramelizing and turning golden brown. (This takes a good 8-10 minutes so be patient, but don't turn up the heat)
- Add the ginger garlic paste and fry for a minute or two.
- Then add in the mutton (goat meat)/ lamb cubes and turn up the heat browning the meat well.
- Once the meat is browned on all sides, add the Kashmiri chilli spices we mixed with water and fry it for 2-3 mins.
-Stir in the whisked yogurt, a pinch of saffron (optional)and salt to taste. Cover and let the curry simmer on medium for 15 mins until the oil starts separating from the curry.
- Once you see the oil start separating, add half of the powdered garam masala (whole spices) and add a cup of water to loosen the curry.
- You can now transfer the curry to a pressure cooker(aka Instant pot) and cook on high for 8-10 mins then natural release the pressure. Or you can lower the heat, cover the pot and allow the curry to simmer for 45mins-60 mins until the meat gets tender.
